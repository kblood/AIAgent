# Enhanced MCP Implementation Guide

This document provides a guide for implementing the enhanced MCP capabilities in the AIAgent project.

## New Files to Create

The following new files need to be created:

1. **EnhancedOllamaMCPAdapter.cs**
   - Path: `AIAgentTest\API_Clients\MCP\EnhancedOllamaMCPAdapter.cs`
   - Purpose: Provides an enhanced implementation of the IMCPLLMClient interface for Ollama models.

2. **FileSystemMCPServerClient.cs**
   - Path: `AIAgentTest\API_Clients\MCP\FileSystemMCPServerClient.cs`
   - Purpose: Implements a client for connecting to an external filesystem MCP server.

3. **MCPServerRegistration.cs**
   - Path: `AIAgentTest\Services\MCP\MCPServerRegistration.cs`
   - Purpose: Provides functionality for registering external MCP servers.

## Existing Files to Update

The following existing files need to be updated:

1. **MCPClientFactory.cs**
   - Path: `AIAgentTest\API_Clients\MCP\MCPClientFactory.cs`
   - Changes: See [MCPClientFactory.patch.md](patches/MCPClientFactory.patch.md)
   - Purpose: Updates the factory to support the enhanced adapter and external MCP servers.

2. **MCPServiceRegistration.cs**
   - Path: `AIAgentTest\Services\MCP\MCPServiceRegistration.cs`
   - Changes: See [MCPServiceRegistration.patch.md](patches/MCPServiceRegistration.patch.md)
   - Purpose: Updates the service registration to use the enhanced adapter.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Create the new files**
   - Use the content provided in the code files.

2. **Update the existing files**
   - Apply the patches described in the patch files.

3. **Build and test**
   - Build the project to ensure there are no compilation errors.
   - Test the enhanced MCP capabilities using the examples provided in the Usage_Example.md file.

## Key Benefits

1. **Improved Tool Calling with Ollama**
   - More reliable tool calling format adherence.
   - Better error handling and response parsing.
   - Lower temperature settings for more consistent results.

2. **External MCP Server Support**
   - Ability to connect to external MCP servers for expanded capabilities.
   - Support for tool discovery and execution via HTTP.

3. **Seamless Integration**
   - Maintains compatibility with the existing MCP infrastructure.
   - No changes needed to the existing UI components.

## Note on IMCPServerClient Interface

The `IMCPServerClient` interface is defined within the `EnhancedOllamaMCPAdapter.cs` file. In a more extensive refactoring, you might want to extract this interface to its own file, but for simplicity, it's included in the adapter file.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Interface for MCP server clients
/// </summary>
public interface IMCPServerClient
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets the available tools from the server
    /// </summary>
    Task<List<ToolDefinition>> GetAvailableToolsAsync();
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Executes a tool on the server
    /// </summary>
    Task<object> ExecuteToolAsync(string toolName, Dictionary<string, object> parameters);
    
    /// <summary>
    /// Checks if the server is available
    /// </summary>
    Task<bool> IsAvailableAsync();
}
```
