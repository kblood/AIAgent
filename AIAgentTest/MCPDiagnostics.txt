MCP DIAGNOSTICS GUIDE

If you're having trouble with MCP servers, follow these steps:

1. VERIFY NODE.JS INSTALLATION:
   - Open a command prompt
   - Run "node --version" 
   - Run "npm --version"
   - Run "where npx"
   If any of these fail, install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

2. INSTALL THE MCP SERVER MANUALLY:
   - Open a command prompt
   - Run "npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
   - This will install the MCP server globally

3. TEST THE MCP SERVER MANUALLY:
   - Open a command prompt
   - Run "npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem C:\some\path\to\use"
   - You should see server output without errors

4. CHECK THE DEBUG OUTPUT:
   - In the AIAgent application, add a server
   - Click the "Debug" button
   - Look for any error messages in the debug output
   - Specifically check if NPX is found and if any errors occur during execution

5. CHECK LOGS IN YOUR APPLICATION DIRECTORY:
   - Look for any "mcp.log" or similar files in the application directory
   - These may contain additional error details

6. VERIFY YOUR ENVIRONMENT PATH:
   - Make sure Node.js paths are in your system PATH variable
   - Typically this should include:
     * C:\Program Files\nodejs\
     * %APPDATA%\npm

If you continue having issues, try running the MCP server manually and configuring the AIAgent to connect to it rather than starting it internally.
